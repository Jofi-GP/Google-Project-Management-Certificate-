# Google-Project-Management-Certificate-
This repository contains a series of 'mock-projects' documentations (artifacts) required to get a project management professional certificate by Google. This was a 7 course series spanning Waterfall, Agile and hybrid methodologies focused on creating project documentation through the various phases of a project. 
The study cases, templates and other information belong to Google Project Management Course. I am only an editor of the content.
This repository is intended only to show my learning process and the type of documentation I learned to create.
